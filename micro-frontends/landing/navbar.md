- Reusability: The navigation bar can be reused across multiple pages, providing consistent navigation throughout the app.
- Independent Deployment: Updates or changes to the navigation bar can be deployed independently, minimizing the risk of affecting other parts of the app.
- Autonomous Teams: A dedicated team can focus on developing and maintaining the navigation bar MFE without being dependent on other teams' work.
- Vertical Services: The navigation bar represents a vertical slice of the app's functionality related to navigation, aligning with the concept of vertical services.
- Flexibility: Separating the navigation bar into its own MFE provides flexibility in customizing or extending navigation features without impacting other components.
