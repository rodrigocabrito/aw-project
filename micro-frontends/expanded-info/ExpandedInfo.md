# Arguments
- Simplicity: Focusing solely on displaying the full-text description of the product simplifies the development of the MFE. Its code remains focused and easier to maintain without the need to manage other page elements or functionalities.
- Single Responsibility: Adheres to the single responsibility principle by managing only the display of the expanded product information. It doesn't concern itself with other functionalities, such as header rendering or page layout, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- Reusability: Can be reused across different pages or apps where detailed product information is required. Developers can easily incorporate it into various application parts without duplicating code or introducing inconsistencies.
- Independent Deployment: Updates or changes to the ExpandedInfo MFE can be deployed independently, allowing teams to iterate on its design or functionality without impacting other application parts.
- Autonomous Teams: Allows autonomous teams to work independently on different application parts. Teams responsible for product information can iterate on its design or functionality without being blocked by other teams.
- Vertical Services: Represents a vertical service that provides detailed product information, contributing to the overall user experience. Its separation into a distinct MFE aligns with the concept of vertical services by focusing on a specific aspect of the app's functionality.
- Flexibility: Offers flexibility in terms of design and implementation. Teams can choose the most suitable technology stack or approach for rendering product information without being constrained by other components.
