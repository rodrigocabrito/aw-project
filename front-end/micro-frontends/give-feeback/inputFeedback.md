# Arguments
- Simplicity: Focusing solely on displaying the input feedback alert simplifies the development process for the MFE. Its code remains focused and easy to maintain without the need for complex interactions.
- Single Responsibility: Adheres to the single responsibility principle by managing only the display of the input feedback alert. It doesn't concern itself with other page aspects, such as header rendering or page layout.
- Reusability: Can be reused across different pages or apps where input feedback alerts are required.
- Independent Deployment: Updates or changes to this MFE can be deployed independently, allowing teams to iterate on its design or functionality without impacting other application parts.
- Autonomous Teams: Teams responsible for input feedback can work autonomously on its design or functionality without being blocked by other teams.
- Vertical Services: Represents a vertical service that provides input feedback functionality, contributing to the overall user experience.
