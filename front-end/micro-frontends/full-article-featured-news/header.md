# Arguments
- Simplicity: Separating the header into its own MFE simplifies the structure of each page, making it clear where to find and manage header-related code.
- Single Responsibility: The header MFE has the sole responsibility of displaying the app's logo or branding, ensuring it adheres to the principle of single responsibility.
- Reusability: This MFE can be reused across multiple pages or applications, maintaining consistent branding throughout.
- Independent Deployment: Updates or changes to the header can be deployed independently, minimizing the risk of affecting other parts of the app.
- Autonomous Teams: A dedicated team can focus on developing and maintaining the header MFE without being dependent on other teams' work.
- Vertical Services: The header represents a vertical slice of the app's functionality from a branding and UI perspective, aligning with the concept of vertical services.
- Flexibility: Separating the header into its own MFE provides flexibility in scaling and evolving the branding or layout independently of other components.
